In development! ðŸš§ An experimental underwater exploration game using procedurally generated cave landscapes.

!['gameplay'](https://github.com/Propolisa/cenote/blob/main/docs/screenshot.png?raw=true)

It uses raymarching and signed distance functions to achieve fast, infinite terrain gen. Running on WebGPU.

I want it to be relaxing!
